# How connect repositories

This text explain how add our change files in github repository using git.

## Existing repository



1. First, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

    ```
    cd /path/to/directory
    ```
2. Next, clone the repository using the command `git clone`. Replace `repository_url` with the actual URL of the repository.
   
    ```
    git clone repository_url
    ```
3. After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory of the repository.

    ```
    cd repository_name
    ```
4. Now, you can make changes to the files in the repository.
5. Once you have made the changes, you can add the changes to the staging area using the command `git add`. Replace `file_name` with the actual name of the file you have changed.
   
   ```
    git add file_name
   ```
6. After adding the changes to the staging area, you can commit the changes using the command `git commit`. Replace `commit_message` with a brief description of the changes you have made.
   ```
    git commit -m "commit_message"
   ```
7. Finally, you can push the changes to the remote repository using the command `git push`.
   
   ```
    git push
   ```

Now, your changes have been successfully pushed to the remote repository.

## Connect to a new repository

If you want to connect your local directory to a new GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Copy the URL of the new repository.
3. In your local directory, initialize a new Git repository and add the remote repository URL.
    ```
    git init
    git remote add origin https://repositoryURL.com
    ```
4. Now you can connect your local directory to the new GitHub repository.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin master
    ```
Now your local directory is connected to the new GitHub repository.

Remember to replace `https://repositoryURL.com` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

Note: If you are using a different branch name other than master, replace `master` with your branch name in the `git push` command.
